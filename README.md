# Colour Helper

Colour Helper is a software recommended for artists that allows you to get the correct paint proportions and then to paint with it onto a real painting with a certain size.

## Home page

This is a page you will see first when you open the program. Here is a gallery of your paintings that have been uploaded so far. Every painting has a name attached to it at the bottom of the painting. Here you can either click on an existing painting and see the details of the whole piece or create a new one via the `Upload` button at the top.

## Upload a new painting

This is a page where you can add a painting to your gallery. First, click on the `Upload` button on the top right corner and select your image from the file dialog system. Once, you have chosen your image, it will be projected onto the windows, and the form will start to show. Now, you can tweak the width and height of your painting, the image ratio is locked, so you do not have to worry about that. An image RGB histogram will show beneath the dimensions of the image, so you can investigate which colours are the strongest and which are the least represented in a certain image. Finally, you can click on the `Create` button.

## The painting itself

When you click from the home page on a certain painting, it will take you to a more detailed page with the information about the one you clicked on. To the left you can see the painting itself but to the right is something more interesting. You can see how many of which colours you would need to recreate this painting in real life. There is always the colour name with the amount in millilitres that you would need. In total there are 13 colours that represent the whole spectrum, and it is sufficient because you can create most of the colours by mixing them together.

## Visual representation

Beneath all the colours and their amounts, you will a see a button for visual representation in graphs of the painting called `Visual`. First, you will see a histogram of the painting, again, and then a bar representation of the colours included in a bar percentage.

## Exporting data

You can also export the colours within a painting by clicking the `Export` button at the top of the form in the painting detail page. Firstly, you need to select the format of exporting which can either be `JSON` or `Plain text`, choose whatever you would like. Then, you need to select the path to where you need the file to be exported. After all that is set, you can click on the `Export data` button and the process will begin.

## Removing a painting

At the top of the form in the painting detail page, you will see a `Remove` button, that if you click, a warning message will show up, if you really want to remove this painting. After you specify that you really want to delete this painting, it will remove itself from the gallery. And after another reload of the application the painting will be also removed from the programâ€™s cache.
